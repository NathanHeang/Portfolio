                        Hello, my name is Nathan Heang!
                        <br>
                        I'm a student reaching for my place in the information technology industry.
                        Despite my youth, I have several years of experience, most notably on my action RPG game, OVERPOWER [see more below], which I programmed in Lua completely on my own. Aside from that, I've also branched out my horizon towards other programming languages, including Rust, C++, Java, and Javascript, as well as markup and stylesheet languages like HTML and CSS, which I've used to create this very portfolio.
                        <br>
                        My passion ignited around 2018, when I was 8, playing video games as most children would, except unlike most children, my curiosity wanted to know how it was made.

                        Overpower is an expansive RPG on the Roblox platform. While Roblox games aren't seen as very impressive, I put years of work and skill into this project, and put together every single model, artwork, animation, and line of code on my own, while also developing these skills farther than I ever could without. This project singlehandedly set in stone that programming was meant for me, and that my passion would take me far in this industry.

                    <h3>Universal Tweaks</h3>
                    <p>Universal Tweaks is a compilation of community bugfixes and tweaks for Minecraft Java 1.12.2.
                        I contributed a tweak to this project when learning Java for the first time.
